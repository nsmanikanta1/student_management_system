Student Management System
A clean and intuitive single-page application for managing students, courses, enrollments, and calculating Grade Point Averages (GPA). This project is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and modern Object-Oriented JavaScript, with no external frameworks or libraries. It's a great demonstration of core web development and OOP principles.
